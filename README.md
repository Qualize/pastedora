**Injecting**

Set your game to windowed fullscreen or you will crash.

**Building from source**

You need to download the DirectX SDK from June 2010: https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/confirmation.aspx?id=6812

Also need to install VS2019 build tools.

Use these settings when opening the solution (an older SDK version will work also).
